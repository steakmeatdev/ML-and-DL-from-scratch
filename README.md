# ANN from Scratch

This project implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) from scratch in Python without using any machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The goal is to provide an educational example of how ANNs work under the hood, focusing on the mathematical concepts and programming techniques involved.

## Features

- **Fully Custom Implementation:** The project demonstrates how to build an ANN step-by-step, including forward propagation, backpropagation, and weight updates.
- **Mathematical Foundations:** Key mathematical concepts like gradients, loss functions, and activation functions are explained and implemented.
- **Educational Approach:** Designed to help students and enthusiasts understand the inner workings of neural networks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib` (optional, for visualization)

Install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

### Running the Notebook

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`ANN_from_scratch.ipynb`) in a Jupyter environment.
3. Run the cells sequentially to understand and execute the code.

## Project Structure

- **Forward Propagation:** Calculates the output of the network given input data.
- **Backpropagation:** Adjusts weights based on the error gradient to minimize the loss function.
- **Activation Functions:** Implements common activation functions like sigmoid and ReLU.
- **Loss Calculation:** Uses a loss function (e.g., Mean Squared Error) to evaluate model performance.
