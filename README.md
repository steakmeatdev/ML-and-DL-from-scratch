# ANN from Scratch

This repository provides a deep dive into the fundamentals of neural networks and machine learning, featuring two key resources:

1. **An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) implementation from scratch**, inspired by the teachings of Guillaume from the [MachineLearnia](https://www.youtube.com/@MachineLearnia) YouTube channel.
2. **A comprehensive slide deck (around 250 slides)** crafted to explain the basics of machine learning, deep learning, and the gradient descent algorithm, designed independently for a deep learning course delivered to the Open Source Club.

## Features

### ANN Implementation

- **Custom Build:** Implements an ANN entirely in Python without libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- **Key Components:**
  - Forward propagation for calculating outputs.
  - Backpropagation for learning via gradient descent.
  - Activation functions such as sigmoid and ReLU.
  - Loss function computation, including Mean Squared Error.
- **Learning-Oriented Design:** Step-by-step code and explanations to help beginners grasp neural network mechanics.

### Slide Deck

- **Educational Focus:** Introduces machine learning and deep learning concepts in an easy-to-follow format.
- **Gradient Descent Explained:** Thorough coverage of the gradient descent algorithm, its mathematical foundation, and its role in optimization.
- **Standalone Resource:** The slides stop at gradient descent and do not delve into forward or backward propagation.
- **Independent Creation:** These slides were developed solely by the author to support the Open Source Clubâ€™s educational goals.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib` (optional, for visualization)
  - `sklearn`
  - `tqdm`

Install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
pip install numpy sklearn
pip install numpy tqdm
pip install numpy numpy
```

### Running the Notebook

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`ANN_from_scratch.ipynb`) in a Jupyter environment.
3. Run the cells sequentially to understand and execute the code.
